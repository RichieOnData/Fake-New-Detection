Detecting Fake News: A Machine Learning Approach

This project tackles the growing threat of misinformation by leveraging machine learning models to classify news as real or fake. Using the ISOT Fake News Dataset, it explores a variety of algorithms including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost â€” with XGBoost emerging as the top performer. The solution features TF-IDF vectorization, Intel-optimized code, and thorough model evaluation using precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC. Future work will include testing additional models and vectorizers, optimizing hyperparameters, and expanding to diverse datasets.
